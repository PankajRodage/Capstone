# Capstone : OLIST Data Analysis Transformation

# Project Description
#### Overview
This capstone project is focused on leveraging data analysis to enhance OLIST's e-commerce operations. OLIST, a major Brazilian e-commerce platform similar to Amazon, aims to harness analytics to optimize its processes and product offerings. The goal is to provide a roadmap for data analysis adoption, demonstrating how strategic use of analytics can deliver substantial business value.

#### Motivation
The project is designed to guide OLIST's leadership in understanding the benefits of data analysis and to create a practical implementation plan. By evaluating feasibility, data requirements, and potential impact, this project will help OLIST's small data analysis team effectively adopt data-driven solutions and maximize their value.

#### Features
Assess the impact of data analysis on OLIST’s business objectives.
Conduct feasibility checks for various data analysis projects.
Determine data and skill requirements for successful project implementation.
Develop a data analysis solution approach based on data strategy principles.
Analyze the changes required in current processes due to data analysis adoption.
Create a proof of concept to validate the proposed solutions.
Define suitable success metrics to measure the project's effectiveness.
Estimate the monetary benefits of implementing the data analysis solutions.
